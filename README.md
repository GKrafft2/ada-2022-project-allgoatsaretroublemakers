# ADA 2022 Project :  ALL Goats Are Troublemakers

## The role of female characters throughout time.
Our society has made massive progress regarding female rights within the last century. But is the media field reflective of that? To consider this question, one can look at the problem from three different angles: movie production, cast and portrayed characters.
* How did the movie production landscape change during the last century? Are women participating in the creation process as directors, screenwriters and operators? What are the dynamics and are there any pivoting figures in this movement?
* What types of women are portrayed in movies? How are racial and age diversity evolving year by year? Are females equally represented in leading and minor roles?
* What types of female characters are prevalent in the films in each period? Are females portrayed as weak or strong? Primitive or complex? Helpless or independent? Are they usually positive or negative characters? How does this depend on the time the movie was produced and on the genre?
